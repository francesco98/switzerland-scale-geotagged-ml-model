# Description

This repository contains some utility scripts to download Switzerland images from Flickr, and to generate an adaptive grid on a map based on the geographical location of these images.

The folder `download_data` contains a script to download the images from Flickr and a script to convert the TXT file (containing all the associated image info) to a JSON file to be used by the algorithm that creates a grid.

The folder `grid_builder` contains a script to generate a grid using the [S2 Geometry Library](https://github.com/google/s2geometry), a package for manipulating geometric shapes. It also contains 3 grid examples:

1. `grid-example.csv`: it is a test on 5K samples obtained from https://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirflickr1m.v3b/. [Click here to visualize the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=13_s0P-rWJmEcrgbyJhJTmZa8TZR3FIs&usp=sharing).
2. `grid-flickr.csv`: it is the grid generated by the JSON file contained in `download_data` folder. Currently it is based only on 8K samples, but it will be soon updated. [Click here to visualize the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ZPlB5PikonTwxZoXN8TOqjaTuKiA5Jk&usp=sharing).
3. `grid-wws-ch.csv`: it is a grid generated on 233K samples obtained from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2557642.2563673. The dataset can be download from: http://skulddata.cs.umass.edu/traces/mmsys/2014/user03.tar.
